3. GPS path tracking: View location and history on a fully offline map (MBTiles)
4. Connection timeline: Live event log of all actions and statuses
5. Speaker toggle: Switch between earpiece and loudspeaker during calls

Requirements:

1. An ESP32 device running server firmware with:
2. Control WebSocket at /ctrl for call, SMS, SOS, GPS, and status messages
